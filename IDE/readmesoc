I am working on a code editor for students! Chromebooks for students often to not allow or do not have room for educational software
apps. My only requirement for this project is that it remains free and accessible to students. A browser delivery system allows even the weakest
computers to run this. I have used vanilla Javascript and JQuery with a CDN to ensure that old computers will be able to run this software.


CodeNoodle is a coding sandbox with live preview updated every keystroke.
This will let you see your work as you experiment with design and run your code with the 
press of a button. 


1.0 Real time live preview code editor.

1.1 Added quick copy for HTML, CSS, JS.

1.2 
Device selection added- adjust your live preview to the screen size of a variety of popular devices
New Blank Workbook
Fixed Bug that was causing iframe not to wrap text

Reach out if you would like to join this project! Here are a few short term features I have planned. I would love to hear your ideas.
A. Current Targets for Development
B. Save File feature
C. Add a collapsible console so users do not need to use the browser terminal
D. Allow users to embed their own images
